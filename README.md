# Portfolio 1.0

Visit my Portfolio [www.bminglouton.com](https://www.bminglouton.com/) built in React. 

# Build

1. Installed [New React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html).

2. Wanted to create a single page portfolio. Used React Props to manage component references in the application and added [SmoothScroll](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/jquery/smooth-scrolling/). Used libraries, wow.js and Animate.css to create animations. 

3. Created different modals for the gallery of projects and used [React Event Handlers](https://reactjs.org/docs/handling-events.html) to show each project modal.

4. Used [formsfree.io](https://formspree.io/) for backend submissions, was very easy to set up and works great. 

5. Found images from unsplash and used icons from flaticon. 

6. The animated background was found at [codepen.io](https://codepen.io/saransh/pen/BKJun) and adapted for the website.
